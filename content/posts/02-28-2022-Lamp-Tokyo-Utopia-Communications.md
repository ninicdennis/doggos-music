## Lamp - A band with a weird name making OUTSTANDING music.

Lamp is probably one of my favorite bands currently. I happened to stumble upon them with their 2008 album [Gensou ランプ幻想](https://youtu.be/shmd-WlaJzU), and ever since then, I have been completely hooked with their music. I have a hard time to describe their music, as its part Jazz, Pop, Lounge, Brazilian, and so much more! On top of that, the vocals are outstanding. Every track they have SCREAMS high quality, and its all I would ever want. I feel personally that these guys are STILL a hidden gem in this world, seeing as City Pop is still raging, their music definitely stand out within the crowd. Many would also agree with me that they should also stay a hidden gem, as they are of insane quality, but I would love them to become the next Plastic Love!

[冷ややかな情景](https://youtu.be/w673bAlDyew?t=553) is my favorite song from the album, just from the slow methodical almost dream like start to a nice and speedy melody, with each instrument being introduced one after another just really "jives" with me. I can feel the passion within the entire song, and even though I have no idea what they are saying, I can feel the emotions they want to bring out!

Right now, I have half of their discography on CD, This album, Gensou (mentioned above), and Dream. I plan to collect their entire discography, as well as at least try to get (hopefully) a reprint of any of their current LP's on their store. If anyone has one they are willing to part with, please let me know!
