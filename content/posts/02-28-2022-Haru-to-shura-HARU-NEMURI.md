## Haru To Shura is a fantastic album.

I thought I would start this off with something more "normal" that I listen to. This album is quite something else, at first, I was thinking this would be kind of a cookie cutter JPOP/JROCK album, but then Haru Nemuri brings out these incredible screams in between tracks that are something else. Some of the backing tracks as well are just really well made, and enjoyable to listen to. I recently stumbled upon this one while scavenging through Bandcamp. I found the LP listen in the top seller section, and took a listen. Instantly I was hooked within a few listens, and decided to pick one up for myself! Since then, I have been listening to this album while driving, and the energy sure keeps me going.

[This song](https://youtu.be/XY9QHQlfNQ8) named 鳴らして is probably one of my favorites, I really love the passion she screams near the end breakdown. definitely some REALLY solid work here, and can not wait to hear more from Haru Nemuri! I would love a little bit more of a stronger backing track in my opinion, and definitely more screams! A great LP to add to the collection!

## Doggo score: 8/10
