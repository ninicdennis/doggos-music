## Hey there.

My name is Doggobot, and I have a weird taste in music. I like to find some of the most obscure music, and love to share it with everyone. This site will be another medium for just that, hoping people connect to the music I enjoy, and to maybe get some more suggestions on other songs! Right now, I am on a Jpop and City Pop kick, but have dabbled in plenty of musical genres! Everything written here will be purely of opinion, and its alright if you don't like my taste, we all have differing opinions!

I hope you have a good day!
